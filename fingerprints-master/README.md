# Fingerprint Image Enhancement
Implementation of fingerprint image enhancement filters. This repo contains two different filtering tools (`gabor` and `wahab`) and a library file for common utility functions (`utils.py`). Below is a general description of all three files. For more information, please read the source code.

## [`wahab`](wahab)
An executable script file that contains the code for applying the Wahab filter. Based on (and named after) [WCT98](#wct98). It consists mainly of a function called `wahabKernel()` that creates a directional kernel for a given orientation, and a function called `wahabFilter()` that divides the image into cells, and convolves each cell with a directional kernel corresponding to the average orientation of the cell.

## [`gabor`](gabor)
An executable script file that contains the code for applying the Gabor filter. Based on [HWJ98](#hwj98). It contains the gaborKernel() function that creates a Gabor kernel for a given orientation and frequency. It contains two functions, `gaborFilter()` and `gaborFilterSubdivide()` processes the image by cell iteration or by area subdivision, respectively. They both
divide the image into smaller chunks, and convolve each chunk with a Gabor kernel corresponding to the average orientation in the chunk.

## [`utils.py`](utils.py)
A Python file that is not meant to be invoked directly, but imported into other scripts. It contains a number of commonly useful functions for fingerprint image enhancement. The most important functions are:

### `convolve()`
A custom convolution function that allows us to convolve a whole image, or just a sub-area of an image.

### `findMask()`
Marks areas as good or bad, depending on the standard deviation of values within the area.

### `estimateOrientations()`
Creates an orientation field for an image, using a combination of the methods from [HWJ98](#hwj98) and [SMM94](#smm94).

### `estimateFrequencies()`
Createsafrequencyfieldforanimage,usingthemethod from [HWJ98].
